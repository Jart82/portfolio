    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a passionate frontend developer with 3+ years of experience building modern web applications.
      I love turning ideas into reality with clean, efficient code and pixel-perfect designs.

      When I'm not coding, you'll find me hiking, reading sci-fi, or experimenting with new tech.
