    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a passionate full-stack software engineer with hands-on experience building modern web applications using
      Angular, NestJS, and Python (Flask). I specialize in creating responsive frontends, designing scalable backends,
      and integrating RESTful APIs to deliver seamless user experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thrive in agile environments, enjoy solving complex technical challenges, and am committed to writing clean,
      maintainable code. I’m continuously expanding my expertise in cloud platforms (Azure), containerization (Docker),
      and performance optimization.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not coding, I’m contributing to open-source, exploring new frameworks, or mentoring aspiring developers.
